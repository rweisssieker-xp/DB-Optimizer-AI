"Statistics on CUSTTABLE are 14 days old. Run:
 UPDATE STATISTICS CUSTTABLE WITH FULLSCAN.
 Old stats cause poor query plans."
 Confidence: 87%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👨‍💻 X++ Developer Pro says:
"Cache results in application layer. This query
 is called 1,200 times with same parameters.
 5-minute cache = 1,199 fewer DB hits."
 Confidence: 85%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏰ Performance Time Machine Analysis

Incident: October 15, 2025 at 14:23:15
Duration: 45 minutes
Severity: 🔴 Critical

📸 Snapshot at Incident:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
System State:
├─ CPU: 98% (normal: 45%)
├─ Queries Running: 245 (normal: 85)
├─ Avg Query Time: 4,500ms (normal: 150ms)
├─ Blocking Sessions: 18 (normal: 0-2)
└─ Memory Pressure: HIGH

Top 5 Queries (at that moment):
1. INVENTTRANS_REPORT: 12,500ms (blocking 8 others)
2. CUSTTRANS_UPDATE: 8,200ms (waiting on lock)
3. BATCH_CALCULATE: 6,800ms (full table scan)
4. REPORT_AGING: 5,900ms (parameter sniffing)
5. INVENTORY_SYNC: 4,200ms (missing statistics)

🔍 Root Cause Analysis:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Primary Cause (85% confidence):
├─ Deployment at 14:15 introduced new report
├─ Report had unoptimized query with full table scan
├─ Query ran every 30 seconds (scheduled job)
├─ Caused locking cascade affecting 8 other queries
└─ System could not recover until job was disabled

Contributing Factors:
├─ Statistics on INVENTTRANS outdated (21 days)
├─ Missing index on TRANSDATE column
├─ Peak hour (14:00-15:00 = highest load)
└─ Connection pool near limit (95% utilized)

🎯 What Would Have Helped:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. ✅ Pre-deployment query review (100% effective)
   → Would have caught unoptimized query

2. ✅ Index recommendation system (85% effective)
   → Would have suggested IX_INVENTTRANS_TRANSDATE

3. ✅ Query timeout limits (70% effective)
   → Would have prevented cascade effect

4. ✅ Statistics update schedule (40% effective)
   → Fresh stats = better query plan

5. ✅ Off-peak deployment window (30% effective)
   → Lower impact during incident

🛡️ Prevention Strategies:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Implement These to Prevent Recurrence:

1. Add to Pre-Deployment Checklist:
   □ Review all new queries with AI Analysis
   □ Test with production-like data volume
   □ Verify execution plans

2. Scheduled Maintenance:
   □ Weekly statistics update on top 50 tables
   □ Daily index fragmentation check
   □ Monthly index recommendations review

3. Monitoring & Alerts:
   □ Alert when query time > 5,000ms
   □ Alert when blocking > 5 sessions
   □ Alert when CPU > 90% for 5 minutes

4. Architecture Changes:
   □ Implement query result caching layer
   □ Add read-only replica for reports
   □ Increase connection pool size

Estimated Prevention Rate: 95%
```
