**Example**:

**Original Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM CUSTTABLE
WHERE DATAAREAID = 'DAT'
  AND ACCOUNTNUM IN (
    SELECT ACCOUNTNUM FROM CUSTTRANS
    WHERE TRANSDATE > '2024-01-01'
  )
ORDER BY NAME
```

**AI-Optimized Query**:
```sql
SELECT c.ACCOUNTNUM, c.NAME, c.PHONE, c.EMAIL
FROM CUSTTABLE c WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ACCOUNTNUM
    FROM CUSTTRANS WITH (NOLOCK)
    WHERE TRANSDATE > '2024-01-01'
      AND DATAAREAID = 'DAT'
) t ON c.ACCOUNTNUM = t.ACCOUNTNUM
WHERE c.DATAAREAID = 'DAT'
ORDER BY c.NAME
```

**AI Explanation**:
```
Improvements Made:

1. SELECT * → Specific Columns
   - Reduces I/O by 60% (eliminated unused columns)
   - Enables covering index usage

2. IN Subquery → INNER JOIN
   - Eliminates repeated subquery execution
   - 3x faster on large datasets

3. Added NOLOCK Hints
   - Reduces locking overhead
   - Safe for reporting queries

4. Added DISTINCT in Subquery
   - Prevents duplicate joins
   - Reduces intermediate result set

5. Early DATAAREAID Filter
   - Critical for AX multi-company
   - Uses clustered index

Estimated Improvement: 75% faster (850ms → 210ms)
```

```

**Auto-Fix**:
```
WHERE TRANSDATE >= '2024-01-01'
  AND TRANSDATE < '2025-01-01'
```

**Explanation**:
```
Why This Fixes It:
- YEAR(TRANSDATE) function prevents index usage
- Rewritten as range scan: uses index IX_TRANSDATE
- Estimated improvement: 95% faster (10,000ms → 500ms)

Impact:
- Logical Reads: 50,000 → 2,500 (95% reduction)

### 6. AI Query Explainer 🔍

**Purpose**: Explain complex queries in simple terms

**Features**:
- Plain language explanation
- Step-by-step query execution
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Optimization suggestions
- Visual execution plan analysis

**Example Explanation**:

**Complex Query**:
```sql
WITH CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT ACCOUNTNUM, COUNT(*) as OrderCount
    FROM SALESTABLE
    WHERE CREATEDDATETIME > DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY ACCOUNTNUM
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
)
SELECT c.NAME, c.PHONE, co.OrderCount
FROM CUSTTABLE c
INNER JOIN CustomerOrders co ON c.ACCOUNTNUM = co.ACCOUNTNUM
WHERE c.CUSTGROUP = 'GOLD'
ORDER BY co.OrderCount DESC
```

**AI Explanation**:

```
What This Query Does (Simple English):

1. Find Frequent Customers (CTE)
   → Looks at orders from last 6 months
   → Counts how many orders each customer has
   → Keeps only customers with more than 10 orders

2. Get Customer Details
   → Matches frequent customers to their contact info
   → Only includes "GOLD" customer group
   → Sorts by order count (most orders first)

Business Purpose:
This query identifies your top "GOLD" tier customers who have
placed more than 10 orders in the last 6 months. Useful for:
- VIP customer outreach
- Loyalty program targeting
- Sales team prioritization

How It Executes:

Step 1: Scan SALESTABLE
  ├─ Filters by date (last 6 months)
  ├─ Groups by customer
  └─ Filters by count > 10
  Time: ~300ms, Reads: 5,000

Step 2: Join to CUSTTABLE
  ├─ Matches customer IDs
  ├─ Filters by CUSTGROUP = 'GOLD'
  └─ Sorts results
  Time: ~150ms, Reads: 1,200

Total: ~450ms, Reads: 6,200

Performance Notes:
✅ Good: Uses CTE (temporary result set)
✅ Good: Date filter uses index
⚠️ Watch: GROUP BY may be expensive with many customers
⚠️ Watch: Sort operation if many results

Potential Issues:
- If OrderCount grows large, sort will be slow
- DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE()) is evaluated once (good)
- CUSTGROUP filter should be early (currently is)

Suggested Improvements:
1. Add index: IX_SALESTABLE_CREATEDDATETIME_ACCOUNTNUM
2. Consider adding TOP N if you don't need all results
3. If run frequently, consider indexed view
```
